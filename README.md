# whats-in-my-cluster

This repository contains scripts to reproduce the analyses presented in the paper:
```
Whatâ€™s in my cluster? Evaluating automated clustering methods to understand idiosyncratic search behavior in verbal fluency.*
```

The repository is organized as follows:
- `analysis`: contains the code for the analysis of participant and rater data
- `forager_test`: contains code for using the python package *forager* to obtain predicted clusters and model estimates

Due to the size of the data and other files, some files are not included in this repository. These files can be accessed via the following link: [https://osf.io/m4dx3/](https://osf.io/m4dx3/). For reproducibility, please download the files and place them in the following directories:

- `data`: access via OSF link and store in subfolder titled `data`, contains the rater data from the pre-registered experiment
- `experiment`: access via OSF, contains the code for the pre-registered rater experiment, programmed in jsPsych
